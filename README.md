# Weather Alert Generator (MuleSoft)

This MuleSoft project provides a weather alert generator application that fetches current weather data from WeatherAPI and displays alerts based on weather conditions. The application is built using Mule 4 and DataWeave, and it can be deployed as a Mule deployable archive.

## Features

- **Dynamic Weather Data:** Fetch weather information based on a city provided as a query parameter.
- **Custom Alerts:** Displays an alert when the temperature exceeds 40Â°C (heatwave) or when wind speed exceeds 50 kph (storm), otherwise, it indicates that the weather is normal.
- **Data Transformation:** Uses DataWeave to extract and transform only the required weather details.
- **Deployable Archive:** Package the project using Maven for deployment on a Mule runtime.
